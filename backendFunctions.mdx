# Backend Functions

> Add secure server-side logic to your Niles app directly through natural language prompts.

## Overview

Backend Functions in Niles allow you to implement custom server-side logic without managing any infrastructure.\
They are deployed automatically and can handle tasks like data processing, API calls, authentication, and automation.

Each Niles app supports backend functions out of the box. You can create them directly from your **prompt** or add them later in the editor.

## What Are Backend Functions

Backend functions are isolated API endpoints that run securely on Niles servers.\
They enable your app to:

- Process data and handle CRUD operations
- Interact with external APIs or databases
- Manage webhooks or scheduled events
- Execute logic that should not run on the client side

Each function has access to your project’s integrations, environment variables, and authentication context.

## How to Create a Backend Function

You can generate backend functions by simply describing them in your prompt.

**Example Prompts**

- “Add a backend function that saves form submissions to the database.”
- “Create an API endpoint that fetches user data from Supabase.”
- “Add a webhook handler that runs when a Stripe payment succeeds.”

When you include a request like this, Niles automatically:

1. Creates a new backend file under `/functions`
2. Defines the endpoint (for example, `/api/submitForm`)
3. Connects it to any referenced integrations
4. Deploys and hosts it automatically

<Note>

All backend functions live inside your project’s `/functions` directory.
