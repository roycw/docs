## **\
Credit usage**

Niles has a usage-based credit system, where sending messages deducts credits. The cost of a message depends on its complexity to ensure you only pay for what you actually use. Many messages cost less than 1 credit, while more complex ones may cost more. This approach allows for more precise edits and greater efficiency per message, making Niles more affordable overall. Here are some example prompts and their cost:

| **User Prompt**                  | **Work done**                                                      | **Credits used** |
| :------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- |
