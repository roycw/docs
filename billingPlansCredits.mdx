## Credits

Credits power your Niles experience.  
Every time you use AI to generate, edit, or integrate something into your app, it counts as one credit.

- **Free plan** â€” Comes with a base set of monthly credits.  
- **Pro plan** â€” Includes 120 credits per month.  

Credits reset at the start of each billing cycle.  
They **do not** roll over to the next month.
