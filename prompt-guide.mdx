# 

Niles is built to turn your ideas into fully working apps—fast. All you need is a clear description of what you want, and Niles does the heavy lifting. No jargon, no setup headaches, just a prompt and a spark.

### The Four Keys to a Great Prompt

1. **Be clear and specific**\
   Say who the app is for, what it should do, and the essentials.\
   _Example: “An app to help fitness coaches manage clients’ workout plans and track weekly progress.”_
2. **Describe the journey**\
   Outline how users move through your app: sign in, create, track, share. The more intuitive your flow, the smoother Niles builds it.
3. **__Focus on what, not how__**\
   Tell Niles what you want—features, style, vibe—and it handles the code, backend, and logic.
4. **Iterate and refine**\
   Start broad, then layer in details. Each tweak sharpens your app closer to your vision.

### Prompt Blueprints

- **Who / What / Why**

  > **WHO:** Independent consultants\
  > **WHAT:** Manage clients, contracts, deadlines in one dashboard\
  > **WHY:** Stay organized and never miss a milestone
- **User Story**\
  “As a freelance designer, I want to send branded invoices and track payments so I can stay on top of my cash flow.”
- **Feature List**\
  I’d like to add:\
  • Lead tracker\
  • Outreach funnel (new → contacted → interested → closed)\
  • Notes & reminders per lead

| :------------------------------------ | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **“Make it more…” / “Make it less…”** | Adjust tone & layout   | “Make the call-to-action bolder because it’s the final step users take.” |
| **“Add a…” / “Remove the…”**          | Add or remove features | “Add a comment section under each task.”                                 |
| **“Change [this] to [that]”**         | Rename or redesign     | “Change ‘Submit’ to ‘Send Request’ to match our friendly voice.”         |
| **“It should feel like…”**            | Style & vibe           | “Like a mashup of Duolingo’s fun with Notion’s clean design.”            |
| **“Add logic for…”**                  | Smart behaviors        | “Send a reminder if a user hasn’t logged in for 3 days.”                 |
| **“Group or organize…”**              | Structure              | “Group tasks by category so users can find them faster.”                 |
| **“Let users…”**                      | Empower features       | “Let users upload documents and tag them for easy search.”               |

### Build in Layers

1. **Start simple:**\
   _“A habit tracker with streaks and reminders.”_
2. **Add depth:**\
   _“Now group habits into themes like Health and Productivity.”_
3. **Refine the vibe:**\
   _“Use color-coded cards and playful emojis.”_
