title: Quick start
---

Welcome to **Niles**! You are only a few steps away from turning your idea into a working app. This guide will walk you through the essentials of creating, refining, and sharing your first project.

---

## The workspace

On the right side is the **Niles chat**. This is where you describe your idea  and guide how your app evolves.  
On the left side is the **live preview**. Every change you request is instantly reflected here. You can also click directly on elements in the preview to adjust them visually.

<Note>
  For every prompt you enter, you can go back into the chat and click <b>Revert This</b> anytime to undo your prompt.
  Youâ€™ll be asked to confirm, and then the app will revert to the state it was in just prior to that point.
</Note>

## The dashboard

On the top bar, you can see the **Settings** button, where you can manage your app beyond the build process. Here you can adjust privacy settings, invite collaborators, add a custom domain, check analytics, or dive deeper into the code if you want more control.

## Build your first app

1. Type a clear prompt into the chat.  
   Example: *Build a task manager where users can create, categorize, and complete tasks while tracking streaks.*

2. Watch as Niles generates your app instantly in the preview window.

3. Refine the details. Ask Niles to adjust layouts, copy, design, or behavior. Use the **visual editor** for pixel-perfect changes.  
   
4. Use **Discuss Mode** in the chat if you want to brainstorm logic or features before committing them to the build.  

5. Interact with the preview as if you were a real user. Confirm that it flows the way you intended.

6. When you are ready, click **Publish** to deploy live. Hosting and deployment are fully handled by Niles.

<Note>
Take things step by step. Start broad, then layer on details. It is easier to iterate forward than to build everything at once.

## Credits

Niles works on a credit system so you can track your usage with clarity.  

**Message credits** are used each time you send a request to Niles to create, edit, or debug.

## Summary

The Niles flow is simple. Describe what you want. See it appear instantly. Refine until it feels right. Share or publish when ready.  

Your idea. Your app. Built in minutes.
