# Quick start guide

Welcome to **Niles**! You are only a few steps away from turning your idea into a working app. This guide will walk you through the essentials of creating, refining, and sharing your first project.

---

## The workspace

On the left side is the **Niles chat**. This is where you describe your idea in plain English and guide how your app evolves.  
On the right side is the **live preview**. Every change you request is instantly reflected here. You can also click directly on elements in the preview to adjust them visually.

:::tip
If you ever want to undo something, type **Revert this** in the chat. Niles will roll back the last change automatically.

## The dashboard

Switch to the dashboard any time to manage your app beyond the build process. Here you can adjust privacy settings, invite collaborators, add a custom domain, check analytics, or dive deeper into the code if you want more control.

---

## Quick actions

Above your preview you will see a row of icons that give you shortcuts to important actions.  
🖥 View usage activity  
📁 Access your files or push to GitHub  
🔗 Share your app link  
📱 Toggle mobile view  
🔄 Refresh the preview  
⛶ Expand to full screen

## Build your first app

1. Type a clear prompt into the chat.  
   Example: *Build a task manager where users can create, categorize, and complete tasks while tracking streaks.*

2. Watch as Niles generates your app instantly in the preview window.

3. Refine the details. Ask Niles to adjust layouts, copy, design, or behavior. Use the **visual editor** for pixel-perfect changes.  
   
4. Use **Discuss Mode** in the chat if you want to brainstorm logic or features before committing them to the build.  

5. Interact with the preview as if you were a real user. Confirm that it flows the way you intended.

6. When you are ready, click **Share** to generate a link or **Publish** to deploy live. Hosting and deployment are fully handled by Niles.

:::tip
Take things step by step. Start broad, then layer on details. It is easier to iterate forward than to build everything at once.

## Credits

Niles works on a credit system so you can track your usage with clarity.  

**Message credits** are used each time you send a request to Niles to create, edit, or debug.  
**Usage credits** apply when your app calls external services or integrations.  

Monitor your credits in your dashboard so you can plan and build efficiently.

## Summary

The Niles flow is simple. Describe what you want. See it appear instantly. Refine until it feels right. Share or publish when ready.  

Your idea. Your app. Built in minutes.
