## Overview

Niles makes it easy to turn any generated app into a membership-based product — complete with a public landing page for visitors and a private members-only area for registered users.

You can use this flow for:

* SaaS dashboards

* Subscription-based tools

* Communities with member access

* Paid content or course platforms

This guide shows how to implement membership logic and design the user landing flow inside your Niles app using built-in tools, authentication providers, and conditional routing.

## Sign Ups and Login

All apps created in Niles automatically include membership functionality.
That means you already have:

Secure Sign-up, Login, and Logout flows

Session handling and private user areas

Ready-to-use components that show content only to logged-in users

You don’t need to request or code any of that — Niles includes it in every generated app.

## How to Add Membership in Your Prompt

If you’d like to control and view your users — such as approving members, assigning tiers, or managing plans — you can ask Niles to create an Admin Membership Section.

This feature is not created by default, but can be fully generated via prompt.

<Note>
Example Prompts:

“Add an admin dashboard where I can see all registered users.”
</Note>


Niles will automatically generate:

* an Admin page (accessible only to you or admin roles)

* a User table with columns like Name, Email, Status, Tier, Joined Date

* optional controls (approve, deactivate, change plan)

* protected routes so regular users can’t access it

## Adding a Public Landing Page

By default, Niles apps are members-only — users must sign up before seeing the app.
If you want to make part of your app public, you’ll need to ask for it in your prompt.

<Note>
Example Prompt:

“Add a public landing page with a hero section, pricing, and a call-to-action to sign up.”
</Note>

Once you include that in your prompt, Niles will:

* Generate a public landing page accessible without login

* Automatically link it to your existing signup flow

* Keep it visually consistent with your app’s theme
