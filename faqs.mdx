## Creating & Editing

### What are “credits”?
Credits measure the number of AI-driven actions you can perform—every prompt or integration use counts as one credit.

### Can I edit my app once it’s built?
Absolutely. Through the AI chat, you can tweak functionality, adjust design, refine tone, and republish—any time.

### What makes a strong prompt?
Be clear and specific. Describe who the app is for, the problem it solves, and any must-have features. The more context you give, the better Niles can deliver.

### What if the app doesn’t match my vision?
No worries—just rephrase your prompt or add more details. Niles is built for iteration and improvement.

### Can I clone my app?
Yes! Go to **Settings → App Settings → Clone App**. A duplicate opens instantly, labeled as a "(Copy)" in your app list.

## Publishing & Sharing

### How are Niles apps deployed?
We handle hosting automatically. As soon as your app is created or updated—it’s live.

### How do I share my app?
Click the share icon in the app’s top-right corner to copy the URL or invite collaborators via email.

### How can I control privacy?
Choose from three settings:
- **Private** — Only invited users can access (login required).  
- **Public (login required)** — Anyone with the link can access, but must authenticate.  
- **Public (no login)** — Accessible to anyone with the link, no login needed.

## Billing & Upgrades

### What’s included in the free plan?
You’ll get enough credits to build, iterate, and test apps—perfect for learning and prototyping.

### What happens if I run out of credits?
You can wait for your monthly reset, earn bonus credits through referrals, or upgrade to one of our paid plans.

### Do unused credits roll over?
No—credits reset monthly and do **not** carry over.

### What’s the difference between plans?
Upgraded plans include more credits, backend features, custom domains, premium support, and beta access.

### Can I cancel my subscription?
Yes—head to your Billing Dashboard, select **Manage Payments**, and choose **Cancel Subscription**. You’ll retain access until the end of your billing cycle.

### How do I redeem a coupon code?
In the Billing Dashboard, use the “Have a coupon code?” field when changing or renewing your plan.

---

## Integrations & Security

### Can I connect external services (like APIs)?
Yes! You can integrate APIs like Stripe, Google Calendar, and more—but this is available on paid plans that support backend capabilities.

### How do API integrations work?
You provide a secure API key, which we store safely as a protected “Secret.” Niles uses it behind the scenes—no one else can access it.

## Best Practices & Community

### Can I get help writing better prompts?

### How can I get feedback?
Share your app in our Discord **#showcase** channel and tap into feedback from fellow creators.
